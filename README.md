# Polygon CMS

You can join in the conversation on our Discord server - https://discord.gg/Bj8fdsD. It's a forum for throwing around ideas, seeing what the latest release notes are, and letting me know if you've found something that's broken. There's only one rule of the server, and that's `don't be a dick`.

### Front end build
The project uses Webpack 4 to compile all of the front end assets into the dist folder. Jump into the Content folder under the Polygon.CMS project and run `yarn install` to get it set up.

You can build the front end pack with `yarn build`

And there's a watch in there so you can update on the fly using `yarn watch`
